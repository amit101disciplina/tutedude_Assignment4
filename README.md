  Case2- (if file is not found 'error handling')
Output-
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.

This script (`Task2.py`) performs the following functionality:
-it exhibits write and append functions with read at the end.
-it takes input from the user in both write and append cases.
-finally it reads the file.
  Example:
Input1:
Hello, Python!
Input2:
Learning file handling in Python.
Output:
Enter text to write to the file: Hello, Python!
Data successfully written to output.txt


Enter additional text to append: Learning file handling in Python.
